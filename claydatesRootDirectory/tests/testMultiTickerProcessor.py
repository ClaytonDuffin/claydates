        could set up tests for the MultiTickerProcessor class by following a similar methodology as was laid out in testSingleTickerProcessor.py and testSingleTickerPlotter.py.
        Adding a second exampleSet.csv file, and a mockResponse argument (as done in singleTickerPlotter.py) would be required to test the functionality of 
        multiTickerProcessor.py and multiTickerPlotter.py in a similar fashion.
